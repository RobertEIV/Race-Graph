# Race-Graph

Ever wonder if we can quantify a racial bias in society?

Using DL4J, we can calculate the word cosine and word association. By looking at those associations we can tell how closely words are related to different races/identities. The Race Graph project allows users to enter a word and see the racial bias with that word.

Enter your words and observe the differences that exist in the way we perceive race. It should be noted, however, that because of the vector bin file used and the way things are calculated that the scores do not precisely quantify a bias. This is rather used as a tool to see how some words are associated with certain races.
